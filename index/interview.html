    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>02:22-02:27 Frans: So well oh... I will just... I like to talk so don't worry... </p>
      <br><br><p> 02:28  Frans: Uhm... Before this thing... Before Vital... I did this other magazine called null-null, which is...
        In dutch means zero-zero. It has nothing to do with the dutch art movement called zero. Or club null I think it was called in the 60s.
        And uhm... this was, this one is from 1986. And I made this with a friend of mine - Christian uhm... long dead now.
        And is very simple typed with a typewriter. One sided  03:19 </p>
        <br><br><p> 03:19-03:22 Frans: In 1986 </p>
        <br><br><p> 03:23 Frans Uhm... 21.</p>
        <br><br><p>03:27 Frans: Yeah.. yeah.. And uh so then.. And this was also connected to the world of mail art.03:43</p>
        <br><br><p>03:45 And stuff like this... Every issue had its own piece of mail art.
          But it was also a magazine that in those days people will send in stuff. Already typed out and with an image
          and stuff like that. You can see where the fonts changes this is my typewriter and this is my dad's typewriter.
          Uhm... This is my dad typewrite but then somebody else gave me this article about industrial music in Belgium.
          So as you is a different typewriter. So I was collecting this stuff and then I did this one...
          I wanted to do more magazines I realised was a bit difficult, but I really wanted to do this James bond thing.
          So 007. Which is actually issue #3. And this is stensil print which is the ancestor of risoprint.04:42 **F**</p>
          <br><br><p>04:44 The previous version is a stensil print. This is the first time I worked with this people (the place where the workshop will take place)
            I think also in 1986. It was may 86 I guess. Still smudging. And uhm so I know this people since those days so 24 years now.
            And then I realised... then the last one was 00 #10. With the old dutch banknote for 1000 gildas.05:23 **F**</p>
            <br><br>
            <br><br><p>05:26 No no this is the finished copy 05:28 **F**</p>
            <br><br><p>05:30 This whole magazine...05:32 **F**</p>
            <br><br><p>05:35 Xerox...05:35 **F**</p>
            <br><br><p>05:39 Yes... in one of these boxes I can show you the original. But yeah...
              This were printed. My dad used to run a company where they had a printing press. And for the money...
              Actually the first book that I made. Was when I was 18. It was this booklet. 06:12 **F**</p>
              <br><br>
              <br><br>
              <br><br><p>06:17 Well ah dkhsd is not my... Oh is not my copy... Is from somebody else. Uhm...
                The interest well... you know when I was even younger like 15 years old. So 1980-81 I got interested in punk music and it was all about
                oh you can do it yourself and stuff like that but then I realised if you want to be in a band you need to find people who you want to do music with.
                 Some damn awkward place to rehearse ten stupid songs and so the whole punk think I only found interesting for maybe one year and then quickly
                 I moved on to getting more interested in electronic music. Because of the electronic music I realised also that there was
                 this other whole other world of mail art. And of cassettes releases, people doing cassettes. And uhm and if you do a casette you can make one copy.
                 If you want to do an addition... a record you have to do 500 copies but a casette you can do only one copy.07:54 **F**</p>
                 <br><br><p>48:53 Alright so, lets talk about how the design evolved. The first one is a paper I just started typing and as you can see I was
                   already into recycling cause I used old photocopies that I did not use. And I did the typewriter thing on my desk typewriter for 3 issues
                   but my father was already... my father was a sort of amateur historian... amateur write of books about music, classical music. So pretty
                   early on we had a computer with a matrix, .matrix printer and my father allowed me when he was working that I can use it. So i printed out
                   this long stripes of text and i printed them out, cut them and stick them on the piece of paper. Which of course was a bit of gamble where
                   to make this stripes but I was also in university at that time, studying history, and there was a small desktop computer room, and all the
                   students had the possibilities to make their own magazines about their own field of interests. They had really this old very first apple
                   macintosh computers. And it was a nightmare, a nightmare because of course my dad did not have an apple macintosh he had whatever a 186 d
                   x or whatever it was called IBM clone thing. So I would type out the text at home and I was already working with somebody. So I would mail
                   it to a big floppy disk to a friend of mine for a little bit correction of the text. The old very first macintosh they could handle the floppy
                   disk but it was not always possible to convert straight one on one. So you open it up and then there is all this weird stuff in it. But
                   the whole idea was it was a really sort off punkick do it yourself thing. So somebody said I will learn you how to do it. This program was
                   called page maker. I will learn you how to do page maker but you have to do it yourself. Which of course sometimes it worked out well because if
                   you have a template you can stick it in. 52:024 **F**</p>
                   <br><br><p>52:02 Yeah.. In some places but it didn't always work because... 52:09**F**</p>
                   <br><br><p>52:12 Yes. But as you can see in... It worked well for these issues but then I don't know what happened.
                     Well, maybe I do know but turns out that is not possible to do proper translation. I would hurry.
                     I think you would have to pay for the hour to use it or two hours or whatever so it was not entirely free.
                     You will have to sign up for specific times to do it. I went back to you know what i will print out this little stripes
                     of paper and I will do it in the old way. So that's all laser printing already but still cut on paste.
                     In some issues and in some issues they were not cut and paste... Anyways total nightmare...
                     And now we have to go to the mystery of why the rest is not here.</p>
                     <br><br><p>53:40 Yeah? And then what I did lets go back to that issue...
                       So when I was done doing this 8 pages I would go to the coffee shop reduce this to a4 and then I had my master.
                        Now what people did if they got it from me. So this is how would you say it - generation 0, then generation 1...
                        the reduced version is number 2. Then I would use the tpex to make all the papers look really good if its fine and then I will
                        make xerox out of it. So that's the second generation people got. So they would put on the yellow thing that was to indicate at
                        home this is my original - I copy from that,. The yellow, you cant copy the yellow. The xerox don't see it. So it let's you know -
                        this is my original. So that's why I think this is from V2. I am pretty sure V2 that is.55:01 **F**</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br><p>55:02 Yes.. Also if it gets lost... They had a small store that would be open on concerts and stuff...
                          Ah that if one of the other issues was lost they could go back to the store and make one of the generation #3 the original.
                          That's why the yellow is still there. And then of course I started to work for Stalplaat. Which was more or less sort of professional label company...
                          without the xerox. But with the benefit of having a lot of professional designers working. And designers with access to /my archive i not really like a organised/
                          but this designers had laser printers. So the girlfriend of my boss she had a laser printer I would do this design and then leave her this space and she would copy that in. But still
                          would be... this is two sheets... I glued them together to know what is back and front. And then of course... So these are the very old mine generations #1 of the first issues. You can see because they are all discoloured.
                          And you can also see I used tpax here to smooth whatever. Stuff like this... Apparently here I was still doing the printout but without doing copy and paste. Also cause I worked with Stalplaat they hired me to do initially to buy and
                          sell stuff for the store and mail order and distribution. They didn't mind that I am doing this stuff. Cause I worked sometimes in the evening etc.
                          But on the other hand it must not take up too much time from other people. So i could not have said to my boss ey Can you ask his girlfriend.
                          His girlfriend is right now actually a very famous dutch artist. Fiona Tan? Have you ever heard of her.57:57 **F** </p>
                          <br><br><p>58:01 She was the girlfriend in the early 90s of my boss in Stalplaat.
                            And she would say why are you doing this stuff for this guy? She didn't like me obviously. So yes this are the first issues.
                            As a first generation I guess. 58:28 **F**</p>
                          <br><br><p>58:29 That big one is generation 0, this is one.
                            And apparently... the other thing with xerox machines technically they should always do the same thing. Make a proper xerox.
                            But there are differences, sometimes the toner is not right and you can still see these sort of lines in between.
                            But is not in any way of form organised.... Sometimes I would just go to a proper place and printed out for my own expense.
                            You see i didn't mark these with yellow. Let me see. Oh yes there is also... So there have been 3 issues of vital in the USA.
                            Ah the first one is the one with the 7inch with the sort of label design. The second one is part of another magazine called report.
                            And the third one is a very small one. I think this is it. 1:00:15</p>
