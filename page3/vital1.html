Frans De Waard would have the original mastercopy which he would reproduce and send to others with the intention that others will make more copies and distribute them even further.

PUBLICATION
REPRINT NOW! VITAL 1
Published by: Frans de Wsard - Opaalstraat 19 - 6534 XK Nijmegen - Holland
As editorials are mostly boring, we will do an editorial for only once. In this we will
explain what VITAL is about. This is a thin .information pamphlet or newsletter or whatever.
We hope tp . publish it every three months. In every issue we will have one interview,
several reviews of records and tapes and news. So far, nothing new. The new thing
comes in when ~e start speaking about the edition, for there is none. We will make of
each issue a certain amount of copies which we will spread around to distributors. But
each distributor will get only 1 copy, a so-called 'mastercopy'. If they want to sell
it, they will have to make xeroxed copies themselves. Every copy is a mastercopy:
We have left enough margin at the top and at the bottom for our american friends, so
that they are able to xerox it on their business sized paper. Well, stepping forward
as always, we hope to serve you with vital information. The stru ggle continues.
COUP OE GRACE
Coup Oe Grace is an organisation with some
reputation. Their creative output so far
included: music, booklets, many appearancss
in magazines and a mail order distribution.
But music is the thing that most of you
will have heard of Coup De Grace. An inter
view with one of the memberswas composed
through mail late 1986, with updates from
more recent letters.
What did you do before C.D.G. 7
I used to build electronic devices, I had
a group which made music with these devices
- at that time I really had no idea
that people compos ed electronic music at
all. It was extremely simple: metronome
beat rhythms, oscilla t ors, dis t orted amplified
guit ars, r el i gi oos s peec hes and
distorted vocals. I was very yoong, but I
designed & built al l th e ins t rument s myself
. I recorde d ene c30 cas s et t e mhi ch
was titled 'The coven of St even Marc at o •.
That was also the name of th e group . I t
comes from the f i lm ' Rosemery!s Baby',
which was one of my favourite . movies es a
child (and stil l is). Before of fi ci all y
startin g COG I spent a lot of ti me f or mulating
the ideas f or i t in my mind. Some
things I later used as COG material were
actually done essli er, li ke th e flyer 'The
Sickn ess ' (in 1st Annual Report) - th at
was pre-COG. Coup De Grace started officially
on 1.17.1984.
- What's more important for COG, music or
visual things? Why 7
The init i al idea behin6 COG was to not have
it be limited to any one medium ••• it
was to be certain philosophies or ideas
C. Cl. G.
COUP CE GRACE
translated into many different forms. Music
was one of them. But now after doing music
for 3 years ws hava gotten discouraged. Whs
we started out not so many people were doin
it & it was more interesting. Now there ass
to be way too many groups doing things without
svsn thinking about what they are eras
t ing. Actually 1crssting 1 is a bad word sin
cs a lot of the ideas are blatantly stolen.
We feel almost ell of the mssic coming out
nowadays is garbage, and we aren't interested
in making music in that kind of situati
on. So, for ths time being at least, we've
ceased recording. Maybe in the future sometime
we'll resume it. Also after thinking
about it we cams to the conclusion that
people are much more affected by what they
see & rssd, than by what they hear. So we're
concentrating on visual material now. Soon
we will begin publishing books, wn the proper
sense. Wa hope to spend more time om
films & fil mmaking, which is something I
personally have been involved with from a
young age.
- Are there many people in the USA interested
in underground activities like COG?
What's it like living in the USA compared
t o Europe (COG was on tour here in september
1986)?
There are people in the USA interested, and
for example Paul (Paul Anthony, COG mail
order service secretary - ad) has told me
that around 90% of the msilorder customers
are American. Living here in the United Stat
es is not something I am particularly fond
of. It's s very money ori ented place. COG
is not interested in money, except when it
is paying for our projects. All the money
we make from the mailordsr-servics goes
back into COG. As doss money that members
make at outside jobs. Europe to ms is not
so money-oriented, at least the atmosphere
sssme not so hectic.
- The work of COG seems to haves good documentation,
why is it important to know
what's around of COG?
I think documentation is valuable as otherwise
many things, for all practical purposes,
would not exist. Everything is a document
in one way or another. All books are
just documents of s writer's thoughts/ideas/
emotions st a given pmint in time. In terms
of COG documentation ·(Like Annual Reports
booklets etc.) - I think these are j ust an
information source for those who cars to
investigate. I don't want it to be too easy
for people to find out or squire materials
we've releases, but it is only fair to let
people know what is available or has been
published. Then if they want to, THEY can
make effort to look for it. With a bit of
persistence and luck, they'll find what they
want •••
- Isn't~ contradiction that the work of COG
has always a small edition, but with a message,
so you will reach only a small audience?
I don't think it's s contradiction. I don't
think that if everyone were forced to see
our material, or if it were easily available
to them, that more than 1% would understand
where we are coming from anyway. But
the small editions also have something to so
with our finances & distribution. So in the
future we will hopefully be doing larger &
lar ger editions, but keeping our original
standards. We will always be much more interested
in quality over quantity.
- Public School is s subject that comes
around in the work of COG quite often, could
you explain this?
Public school (and private school - in fact
eduction in general) is something which was
integral to our initial work. I t was the
main impetus behind many of our first recordings,
which appear on Commencement (The
first Coup De Grace tape, now sold out - ed).
I had been attending school up until t he exact
day that Commencement was released. On
that day I left school and haven't been back
since. Everyt hing I have seen and witnessed
so f ar in my life which calls itself 'education'
has always upon close scrutiny revealed
itself (at least to me) to be whomly
against forging people of intelligence. It
actually fosters a hatred of learning. Most
everything I have learned of value I taught
myself, on my own time. So st one time involuntary
'eduction• was s part of my day
to day existence. This is no longer true.
Therefor I doubt it will plays part in our
future projects. Actually no recordings
since 1984 have been at al l s pecific~lly
concerned with the subject of education. It
does still interest us though.
- How important i s mt to be extreme as possible
or sreth ere also other things import
ant?
I do not think there is any such thing as
being extreme. It is a wholly subjective
matter. So it is impossible for me to answer
this question. I could not honestly say
that I feel any COG release has ever been
'extr eme•. The thought has never crossed my
mind. We'll let the people who see it & hear
it, call it what they will. It real l y does
not matter to us. We ourselves have no pretentions
of being 'extreme' or anybbing else.
We do what we do & we stand by it. I can say
that for the future our activities will only
get stronger & more powerful. Something to
be reckooed with •••
Some information must be given on Coup De
Grace as an update to this interview. Micheal
of Coup De Grace has come to Europe to
live here for s while. Coup De Grace is
planning a memorial album with tracks from
their long deleted first tape+ live and ·
unreleased material. Also three books will
appear. Also some plans exist for releases

RECORD REVIEWS
NURSEW ITHW OUND/THTEE RMITEQ UEEN- 7"
(WW Bl) Nurse With Wound is one of my favourite
bands, so please don't expect any
objective review. O.K. this is a good
7" single, that's not the reason why I
wanted to r eview it. This review is ment
as s complaint: this single is packed in
a shabby black pa per. It has a small black
and white bidding with the r emark Nurse
With Wound - Crank .and The Ter mite Queen -
Wisecrack and WW0 1 (What does WWm ean?).
The labels of the single are totally black,
of course with no infor mation. As a real
collector I looked at the scratchings in
the centre, but again no information. This
should cost you 2.so pounds. But i t 's the
music tha t counts of course. And the music
is good, altough it sounds like two times
Nurse With Wound.
This 7" is also available fro m United Dairies
which have currently made all the old
deleted records available on tape again.
Most of them in their original form, some
albums are remixed, like 150 Murderous
Passions and NWW's Insect and Indiaidual
Silenced. Check this out. Bytheway: Anyone

OE FABRIEK/RTC- IS IT SAFE? (7" on De
fabriek Records & Tapes fabprod 6). Two
groups from Holland on a 7" against nuclear-
energy. De fabriek is fro m these t wo
the most well-ll:nown. Their track on this
single sounds like their recent album 'Mads
In Spain', that is industrial, with a
heavy rhythm and sounds coming in and going
out. Their side is on 33 RPM, whilst the
other is on 45 RPM. ATC'@ mesic is hard to
describe. It is very rhythmic with all
kinds of percussion and mumbl ing voices.
Their experi mental influence is not industrial
but more ethnic. This single was
pac ked in a dark-pink wall paper cover wit h
blue prints. A limited edition of about
279 copies. So hurry. When you ask abou t
th i s, don't for get to obtain t heir catal

BC Zwolle - Hol l and
Pl6 04 - Tionchor (Album on Selektion Records
slp 013). Again, this is one of my
favourite bands. On this new album you will
15 tracks that have been previosly evailaT
ble on compilation tapes and records. How
these were selected is not clear to me, but
it doesn't matter. Even if you are a collector
who has all Pl6 04 material you must
have this record, because in some cases
they remixed the tracks. for those unfamiliar
with their sound, I must say that it
is a fine combination of free-jazz (mainly
the old stuff) and musique concrete (the
new things). b!hat I like part~culary about
this album is that all tracks are well documentated
(recording dates, instruments
etc.). On the backside you will find their
extensive discography. But there is one item
missing there and I like to mention it
here in the way they do it:

LIEUTENANTC ARAME-L LA BOITE OE PANDORE/

to prove that we are right about the

of Dernier Du Cults, a bend of which I don't

beet in this genre. Very varied music, very
good collage of music and above ell good

him a tape with their favourite sounds,
like radio voices, birds, gloomy sounds,

The Haters added a few of his destroyed music
loops to it (car-crashes, falling glass

that it sounds more like The Haters than
like la Sonorite Jeune (I heard their first

to review all of them. One of hand their
music consists of sampled noise (very short
pieces of orcheetra 1 e, machine noises etc.)
and on the other hand their music is a bit
like the music from New Carrollton. You
never know what to expect. Also the aspect
of very long tapes, makes is hardly possible
